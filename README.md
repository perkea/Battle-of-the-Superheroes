### Path followed
Perhaps this is a sentiment you’ve thought of before as you daydreamed about a game project that could be amazing if only you could make it reality. 
Designing the game: 
Developing that idea further, I took plain old paper and pen and drew my game as i pictured it in my head.
Making the game: This is where you begin to create the game. 
Deployment the game: This is when you publish your game for everyone to see.


 
### The Goal
The goal is to be the first player to get all 52 cards. The deck is evenly divided, each player recieving 26 cards each.

The player turns up a card at the same time as the computer and the player with the higher rank takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player draws 4 cards and the ranks of the fourth cards are compared. The player with the higher rank takes both piles. The player with the higher rank takes all 10 cards, and so on.
